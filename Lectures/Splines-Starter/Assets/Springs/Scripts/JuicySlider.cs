/*
   A Unity Slider whose handle springs to where you click or drag instead of jumping there.

   How Unity's Slider works: it keeps one number, value, and draws the handle and fill from it.
   Every way of changing that number ends in one method, Set(input, sendCallback): dragging,
   clicking the track, the arrow keys, and code that assigns slider.value. Set clamps the number,
   stores it, redraws, and (when sendCallback is true) fires onValueChanged.

   The trick, and why it looks odd: Set is virtual, so the same method name reaches two versions.
     - Everyone else calls Set: the Slider's own drag, click and key handling, and any other code.
       Because we override it, those calls come to our version. It does not move the handle; it
       changes the target behind the scenes, spring.equilibrium.
     - Only our Update calls base.Set, the Slider's original version, with the spring's current
       position. That is what moves the handle and the fill.

   So the Slider's own value is now only what is drawn this frame, and the number the user asked
   for lives in the spring:
     spring.equilibrium  where the user asked to go (the target)
     value               where the handle is drawn right now (the spring's position, bouncing)

        // base.Set changes the visual location of the slider handle. Make sure sendCallback is off,
        // so listeners only respond to the target value and not the in progress interpolated spring value
    }

        // TODO: Set the spring's new equilibrium. Don't call base.Set here (that moves the handle and
        // should happen in Update). If sendCallback is on and the target changed, invoke onValueChanged
        // with the new target so listeners (e.g. a volume control) know what the value will change to.
